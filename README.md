# SECURITY AUDIT LAB

## Objective

The Security Audit Lab project aimed to mimic the conditions for a real-world security audit. The primary objective was to complete an internal security audit for a fictional company. The goal of the audit was to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The tasks involved reviewing the scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, to perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.

### Step Four

Description: Provide recommendations, related to controls and/or compliance needs, to reduce risks to assets and improve Botium Toys’ security posture.

Botium Toys lacks several crucial security controls. These include: Least Privilege, password policies, an IDS, legacy system management, encryption, and a password management system. Sensitive information is currently open to threats, both internal and external, due to the weak security posture.

Additionally, several gaps in compliance exist. Botium Toys  will need to properly classify assets in order to address potential gaps in security posture that were not caught by this security audit. This will enable the company to better protect sensitive information.
